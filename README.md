# Introduction to LangGraph

This repo hosts the code I developed while taking the [Introduction to LangGraph](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph) course.

The code was developed to follow along the course lessons, so it was pretty much inspired by the course material. I highly encourage taking this course.
